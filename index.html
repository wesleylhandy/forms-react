To prepare the 2019 survey, field teams overseen by Brown & Fraser completed 17,692 interviews in 36 cities or regions of 10 countries. In surveyed countries, CBN&rsquo;s largest audiences were in Indonesia, India, Philippines and Nigeria. Brown & Fraser then applied the results from these and prior years&rsquo; surveys to project audience sizes of CBN programming."
